THE REEKTOR LICENSE

This file will go over everything you are allowed to fork, copy, share etc. in the Rektor database project.
To keep it clear: we will NOT be keeping this up for warranty and liability, but we will fully allow commerical use
and use of the name that isn't related to Rektor DB.

1. FORKING
Overall, you can play around with the given code as much as you want. As long as you don't break shit and actually go over
your code. I don't want people screaming about some dumb problem in the code that somehow happened because we let someone
commit code that became unnoticeable to other contributors simply because they didn't bother testing it until it's too
late.

2. COPYING
Like said before: we don't mind if you use the term 'Rektor' and not refer to the Rektor DB project. It's not like this
belongs to me. This is a fork in itself of a pre-revenue project.

3. SHARING
